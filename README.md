Summary
-------

Figure out what's giving your Go binaries so much mass.  This provides a report
broken out by package and symbol so that you can see exactly where your
precious storage is being used.

Project Status
--------------

This project is still under development.  Currently this just emits json.
That's useful, but verbose.  I would like to explore providing an ncurses view
for interactive exploration.
